I am a child development researcher with a background in psychology and communication. My research interests lie at the intersection of basic research in child development (with particular focus on language acquisition) and applied intervention research for preschool and school children. My work focuses on how language acquisition is shaped by linguistic factors (e.g., characteristics and intrinsic learnability of the ambient language), interactional factors (e.g., quantity and quality of parent-child interactions), environmental factors (e.g., learning support in the home, structural and process quality in daycare/school, exposure to pollutants), and clinical factors (e.g., supraphysiological prenatal exposure to steroid hormones). I am currently working on a large project funded by TrygFonden and aimed at developing, testing, and evaluating a nation-wide intervention to improve language, math, and socio-emotional skills of children transitioning from preschool to school in Denmark.

                    Background
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent chemicals used in everyday consumer products leading to ubiquitous human exposure. Findings of impaired neurodevelopment after prenatal exposure to PFAS are contradictory and few studies have assessed the impact of postnatal PFAS exposure. Language development is a good early marker of neurodevelopment but only few studies have investigated this outcome separately. We therefore investigated the association between prenatal and early postnatal PFAS exposure and delayed language development in 18 to 36-month-old Danish children.
Methods
The Odense Child Cohort is a large prospective cohort. From 2010 to 2012 all newly pregnant women residing in the Municipality of Odense, Denmark was invited to participate. Concentration of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were assessed in maternal serum collected in the 1st trimester of pregnancy and in child serum at 18 months. Parents responded to the Danish adaption of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDI) when their child was between 18 and 36 months. Language scores were converted into sex and age specific percentile scores and dichotomized to represent language scores above or below the 15th percentile. We applied Multiple Imputation by Chained Equation and conducted logistic regressions investigating the association between prenatal and early postnatal PFAS exposure and language development adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, education and respectively fish intake in pregnancy or childhood and duration of breastfeeding in early postnatal PFAS exposure models.
Results
We found no significant associations between neither prenatal nor early postnatal PFAS exposure and language development among 999 mother-child pairs.
Conclusion
In this low-exposed cohort the finding of no association between early postnatal PFAS exposure and language development should be interpreted with caution as we were unable to separate the potential adverse effect of PFAS exposure from the well documented positive effect of breastfeeding on neurodevelopment. We, therefore, recommend assessment of child serum PFAS at an older age as development of the brain proceeds through childhood and even a small impact of PFAS on neurodevelopment would be of public health concern at population level due to the ubiquitous human exposure.  </div>

Introduction: Maternal thyroid function in early pregnancy is crucial for fetal neural development. Early offspring language acquisition is an important indicator of fetal neural development and a predictor of future cognitive development. We aimed to investigate how the mother’s thyroid function and the presence of thyroid autoimmunity in early pregnancy are associated with offspring’s language acquisition at the age of 12-37 months.

Methods: This study was embedded in the prospective Odense Child Cohort (OCC). Mothers were excluded in case of known thyroid disease. A blood sample was drawn at median 12th gestational week (range: 8-20) and analyzed for free thyroxine (FT4), thyrotropin, and anti-peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb). The Danish adaption of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDI) parent reports was assessed every third month when the child was 12-37 months and was used to evaluate the offspring’s vocabulary. Data from all completed MB-CDI reports (productive vocabulary) for each child was included in the analysis. Associations between maternal FT4, thyrotropin, and TPOAb, respectively, and scores in the MB-CDI were evaluated by conditional growth models, with thyroid variables as predictors, estimating inter-individual variability in intra-individual patterns of change (in MB-CDI-scores) over time (offspring age) and main effects of covariates.

Results: The study included 735 mother-child pairs (383 boys and 352 girls). The probability of producing words within the MB-CDI at the age of 12 to 37 months correlated negatively with maternal FT4 in both girls and boys (P < 0.001). Likewise, language acquisition was better in both girls and boys when maternal FT4 was below the 20th percentile compared to children exposed to a maternal FT4 above the 80th percentile (P < 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively). Language acquisition was better for girls with maternal thyrotropin >2.5 mIU/L than for those with maternal thyrotropin ≤2.5 mIU/L (P < 0.001). The same trend was evident for boys after the age of 27 months (P < 0.001). Language acquisition at age 12-37 months for both girls and boys was inversely correlated with TPOAb levels, as TPOAb >11 kIU/L decreased the probability of producing words compared to those with maternal TPOAb levels <11 kIU/L (P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Language acquisition in offspring at age 12-37 months correlated inversely with maternal FT4 and serological markers of thyroid autoimmunity in early pregnancy. Thus, thyroid autoimmunity per se may have a negative impact on fetal neural development. However, the finding that maternal thyroid function in the lower-normal range may be favorable for language acquisition contrasts with the current perception.  </div>

Does sex/gender matter for language acquisition? Small advantages in vocabulary size for females are well documented. In this study, however, we found that children’s early vocabulary composition was a significantly better predictor of sex/gender than their vocabulary size. We conducted classification analysis on word-production data from children (12–36 months old, n = 39,553) acquiring 26 different languages. Children’s sex/gender was classified at above-chance levels in 22 of 26 languages. Classification accuracy was significantly higher than for models based on vocabulary size and increased as a function of sample size. Boys produced more words for vehicles and outdoor scenes, whereas girls produced more words for clothing and body parts. Classification accuracy also increased as a function of age and peaked at 30 months, reaching accuracy levels observed in studies of adult word use. These differences in vocabulary are indicative of differences in the lifeworld of children and may themselves cause further differences in development.</div>

Language development during early childhood is considered an important marker of fetal neurodevelopment. Prenatal cortisol exposure plays a critical role in maturation of the fetal brain; however, the effect on offspring language development needs further investigation. In this prospective observational study we aimed to evaluate the association between maternal third trimester cortisol and early longitudinal offspring language development in the Odense Child Cohort (OCC) and to test whether there were sex differences in the association. The study cohort included 1093 mother–child dyads (570 boys and 523 girls). Fasting morning serum (s-) cortisol was collected from third trimester (gestational week 26–28) pregnant women and measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Offspring receptive and productive vocabulary assessments by MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories parent reports were completed every third month from children age 12–37 months. Levels of cortisol were higher in women carrying a girl (858 ± 214 nmol/L) than in women carrying a boy (820 ± 222 nmol/L). Higher third trimester maternal cortisol levels showed a positive association with development of productive vocabulary in boys at age 12–21 months (OR = 1.23, SE = 0.07, p =.005) and age 22–37 months (OR = 1.09, SE = 0.06, p =.967). Higher maternal cortisol levels in the third trimester were positively associated with receptive vocabulary in girls at 12–21 months of age (OR = 1.16, SE = 0.05, p =.002). Maternal third trimester s-cortisol levels were positively associated with early language development in children at age 12–37 months.</div>

Parenting self-efficacy has been tied to myriad child outcomes during middle childhood and adolescence, directly and indirectly through parenting practices. The present study examines contemporaneous associations between parenting self-efficacy, parenting practices, and child outcomes during the preschool years in a community sample of 1455 Danish parents (76.7 % mothers) of 3–5-year-old children (49 % girls). Parents (M = 39.2 years old) completed a survey describing parenting self-efficacy and three facets of parenting practices: inductive reasoning, psychological control, and instrumental reward. Parents also described child adjustment in four domains: prosocial behavior, hyperactivity, conduct problems, and emotional problems. Results revealed direct concurrent associations between parenting self-efficacy and each child outcome, with greater efficacy tied to more prosocial behavior and less hyperactivity, conduct problems, and emotional problems. Parent psychological control mediated associations from parenting self-efficacy to child hyperactivity, conduct problems, and emotional problems. Inductive reasoning mediated associations from parenting self-efficacy to child prosocial behavior. Consistent with previous findings from older children, parental use of psychological control had debilitating consequences for preschool children. Inductive reasoning, in contrast, appeared to promote positive development.</div>

The world’s languages vary in almost every conceivable way, yet children readily learn their native language. Understanding how children can acquire such a diversity of different languages has been a long-standing goal for psychological science, yet current acquisition research is dominated by studies of children learning one particular language: English. In this article, we argue that progress toward this goal will require systematic comparisons between different languages. We propose three levels of comparison: coarse-grained comparisons contrasting unrelated languages to confirm or refute broad theoretical claims, fine-grained comparisons between closely related languages to investigate the impact of specific factors on acquisition outcomes, and within-language comparisons targeting the impact of socio-communicative differences on learning. This three-pronged comparative approach to language acquisition promises to provide new insights into the mechanisms and processes by which children acquire their native tongue under such varied linguistic and socio-communicative conditions.</div>
