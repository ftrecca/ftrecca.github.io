                    Parent-child reminiscing elicits rich speech input from parents, which in turn predicts positive child language outcomes. Yet, some child behavioral traits may moderate the ability to turn high-quality speech input into conversational skills. Given recent findings showing that disruptive behavior affects shared book reading, we investigated whether child hyperactivity and conduct problems moderate the influence of parent speech input during reminiscing on children’s language growth.

                    N = 178 Danish parents and their 4-6-year-olds reminisced about past events in two home visits two years apart. Parent and child speech were coded for quantity (rates of utterances, word tokens), linguistic quality (word types, labeling, MLU), and interactive quality (directives, questions, and repetitions/expansions). Hyperactivity and conduct problems were assessed via the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.

                    Initial results show that higher parent linguistic and interactive quality predicts greater language growth in children with below-average hyperactivity, but not in those with above-average hyperactivity (βs = –0.18 - –0.33), with the strongest effects for interactive quality. Conversely, the effect of parent speech quality is positive for children with above-average conduct problems, but not for those with below-average conduct problems (βs = 0.16 - 0.18). Analyses also suggest moderation by parent education, with larger effects for parents without a college degree.

                    The findings suggest that impulsiveness/inattentiveness may act as a resistance factor and hinder language gains, while conduct problems may amplify the positive effect of rich parent speech input. Both findings have important implications for intervention.

                    Children learn language at very different rates. Some are fast from the outset; some are slower; some need intervention to achieve functional skills. Individual differences are observable early on and are enduring, and they are affected by both child and parent characteristics. Still, the mechanisms of association and prediction are not fully elucidated.

                    We followed 1,800 Danish mother-child dyads from gestation to the child’s third year. Maternal SES and parenting cognitions and practices were assessed via surveys before and after birth. Child vocabulary development was assessed in the age range 12–30 months using the MB-CDI, and we collected test scores from the mandatory national language assessment program at age 36 months. Our objectives were to (1) identify latent patterns of early vocabulary development, (2) assess whether these patterns predict language and pre-literacy skills at 36 months, and (3) identify parent and child characteristics that affect these patterns.

                    We identified four latent vocabulary growth patterns—fast learners, slow learners, and two intermediary groups. Steeper vocabulary growth predicted higher language (i.e., productive language, language comprehension, communicative skills) and pre-literacy (i.e., phonological awareness) test scores, with differences of up to 3 standard deviations on the outcome between the steepest and the shallowest curve. Children in the slowest growth curve had up to 10x greater risk of scoring below the national diagnostic threshold for language intervention (i.e., < –1 SD from the mean) than the other groups. 

                    Notably, no mother or child background (SES) factors explained differences in vocabulary growth patterns. However, language-related parenting practices (e.g., frequency of shared book reading, number of children’s books, and other language and literacy supporting activities) were strong predictors. The findings suggest that later language and pre-literacy skills are, at least partially, influenced by early parenting practices that constitute potentially malleable targets for intervention.

                    APA defines a trait as “a relatively stable, consistent, and enduring internal characteristic that is inferred from a pattern of behaviors, attitudes, feelings, and habits in the individual.” There is an interest in studying alignment as a trait variable: it has been correlated with a wealth of other individual differences (e.g., Riccardo et al., 2019). Although alignment is implicitly assumed to be trait-like, it has never been tested whether alignment displays the characteristics of a trait, namely, stability across time and context.

                    Children in foster care lag substantially behind their peers in cognitive and socio-emotional skills (Blake et al., 2022; Melkman, 2020). However, the evidence on skill development of children in foster care compared to their peers in the preschool years is still sparse. The aim of the present study was to compare differences in and associations between language, numeracy, and socio-emotional skills, and executive functioning among 3-5-year-old among children in foster care and their peers. 

                    The sample consisted of n = 118 Danish children placed in foster care and n = 131 children in comparison group (Mage = 4.4), who took part in a larger reading intervention as control groups. The data is based on pre-intervention measures. Child language skills were measured with standardized language tests. Early numeracy was measured using PALM (Purpura & Reid, 2016) and PENS (Purpura et al., 2015). Executive functioning was measured using Early Years Toolbox (Howard & Melhuish, 2017). Child socio-emotional outcomes were measured using the SDQ-questionnaire (Arnfred et al., 2019). 
                    
                    Children in foster care scored approximately 1 SD below their peers in vocabulary, rhyme, deletion, and math vocabulary, and approximately 0.5 SD below the comparison group in executive functioning. Children in foster care had 9-72 % higher risk for developing socio-emotional problems compared to their peers, with the highest risk for problems in social skills. There were strong significant correlations between language, numeracy skills and executive functioning (rs = 0.75-0.53). Vocabulary and deletion skills, respectively, correlated sig. negatively with peer problems (rs = -0.21; -0.18), among children in foster care.

                    The present study examined the influence of the context of interaction, parent education level, and parent gender on the quantity and language acquisition- supporting quality of parents’ talk with their 3- to 5-year-old children. The conversations of 155 Danish parent-child dyads (41 fathers; 79 boys) in book sharing, reminiscing, and LEGO toy play were recorded, transcribed, and coded for indicators of linguistic and interactive quality. Book sharing and reminiscing elicited higher quality speech than toy play but did not diminish education-related differences in parent speech quality. Higher levels of parent education were associated with higher linguistic quality and linguistic contingency of parent speech. There were no effects of parent gender. The findings support the use of book sharing and reminiscing in parent-implemented interventions to enhance children’s language experience, with the caveat that these interventions will not eliminate gaps in children’s early language- learning experience associated with parent education.

                    The Germanic languages are arguably among the world’s most well-studied languages. However, the language acquisition literature is still widely dominated by studies of English, whereas other languages (e.g., Faroese and other Scandinavian languages) are heavily underrepresented. Systematic fine-grained comparisons between Germanic languages are needed to lay the foundation for a detailed description of similarities and idiosyncrasies in the acquisition of phonology, vocabulary, morphology, and syntax. Such comparisons are made possible by the use of standardized and norm-based tools, cross-lab experiments, and cross-linguistic corpora that make findings from different Germanic languages comparable. General trends can thus be derived from the data, and many commonalities are to be expected. Some common developmental trends extend to all languages and pertain to constraints imposed by the developing cognitive system/speech system (e.g., the ability to perceive and produce given sounds before others); other trends are common to the Germanic languages and are associated with shared typological traits (e.g., the phonological resemblance between among several early words or the similarity of some morphological systems).
                    Divergences from such common developmental patterns are just as interesting, sincethey are indicative of the ways in which language-specific properties can affect—facilitate or impede—the acquisition of Germanic languages. The concrete timing of development is highly affected by the complexity of the phonetic/phonological, lexical, morphological, and syntactic elements that are relevant in the ambient language, as well as by their frequency, predictability, and perceptual saliency. The simplicity vs complexity of a structure are not the only determinant of whether a specific structure will be acquired earlier vs later; infrequent, less predictable, and less perceptually salient forms can pose a challenge for the young listener independently of complexity.

                    <strong>Objective:</strong> Maternal thyroid autoimmunity and thyroid function in early pregnancy may impact fetal neurodevelopment. We aimed to investigate how thyroid autoimmunity and thyroid function in early pregnancy were associated with language acquisition in offspring at 12-36 months of age.
                    <strong>Methods:</strong> This study was embedded in the prospective Odense Child Cohort. Mother-child dyads were excluded in case of maternal intake of thyroid medication during pregnancy. The parents completed MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDI) every third month to assess their offspring’s productive vocabulary. All completed reports for each child were included in the analyses. Logistic growth curve models evaluated associations between MB-CDI scores and levels of maternal thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), free thyroxine (FT4), and thyrotropin, respectively, measured in early pregnancy (median gestational week 12). All models were stratified by offspring sex and adjusted for maternal age, education, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, breastfeeding, and offspring age. 
                    <strong>Results:</strong> The study included 735 mother-child dyads. Children born to mothers with TPOAb >=11 kIU/L, opposed to TPOAb <11 kIU/L, had a lower probability of producing words at age 18-36 months for girls (OR=0.78, p<0.001) and 33-36 months for boys (OR=0.83, p<0.001). The probability of producing words was higher in girls at 30-36 months of age with low-normal maternal FT4 vs. high-normal FT4 (OR=0.60, p<0.001), and a similar trend was seen in boys. Results were ambiguous for thyrotropin.
                    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> In women without known thyroid disease, TPOAb-positivity in early pregnancy was negatively associated with productive vocabulary acquisition in girls and boys. This association was not mediated by a decreased thyroid function, as low-normal maternal FT4, unexpectedly, indicated better vocabulary acquisition. Our results support that maternal thyroid autoimmunity per se may affect fetal neurodevelopment.

                    In language learning, learners engage with their environment, incorporating cues from different sources. However, in lab-based experiments, using artificial languages, many of the cues and features that are part of real-world language learning are stripped away. In three experiments, we investigated the role of positive, negative, and mixed feedback on the gradual learning of language-like statistical regularities within an active guessing game paradigm. In Experiment 1, participants received deterministic feedback (100%), whereas probabilistic feedback (i.e., 75% or 50%) was introduced in Experiment 2. Finally, Experiment 3 explored the impact of mixed probabilistic feedback (33% positive, 33% negative, 33% no feedback). The results showed that cross-situational learning of words was observed without feedback, but participants were able to learn structural regularities of the miniature language only when feedback was provided. Interestingly, the presence of positive feedback was particularly helpful for the learner, promoting more in-depth learning of the artificial language.

                    Background
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent chemicals used in everyday consumer products leading to ubiquitous human exposure. Findings of impaired neurodevelopment after prenatal exposure to PFAS are contradictory and few studies have assessed the impact of postnatal PFAS exposure. Language development is a good early marker of neurodevelopment but only few studies have investigated this outcome separately. We therefore investigated the association between prenatal and early postnatal PFAS exposure and delayed language development in 18 to 36-month-old Danish children.
Methods
The Odense Child Cohort is a large prospective cohort. From 2010 to 2012 all newly pregnant women residing in the Municipality of Odense, Denmark was invited to participate. Concentration of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were assessed in maternal serum collected in the 1st trimester of pregnancy and in child serum at 18 months. Parents responded to the Danish adaption of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDI) when their child was between 18 and 36 months. Language scores were converted into sex and age specific percentile scores and dichotomized to represent language scores above or below the 15th percentile. We applied Multiple Imputation by Chained Equation and conducted logistic regressions investigating the association between prenatal and early postnatal PFAS exposure and language development adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, education and respectively fish intake in pregnancy or childhood and duration of breastfeeding in early postnatal PFAS exposure models.
Results
We found no significant associations between neither prenatal nor early postnatal PFAS exposure and language development among 999 mother-child pairs.
Conclusion
In this low-exposed cohort the finding of no association between early postnatal PFAS exposure and language development should be interpreted with caution as we were unable to separate the potential adverse effect of PFAS exposure from the well documented positive effect of breastfeeding on neurodevelopment. We, therefore, recommend assessment of child serum PFAS at an older age as development of the brain proceeds through childhood and even a small impact of PFAS on neurodevelopment would be of public health concern at population level due to the ubiquitous human exposure.  </div>

Introduction: Maternal thyroid function in early pregnancy is crucial for fetal neural development. Early offspring language acquisition is an important indicator of fetal neural development and a predictor of future cognitive development. We aimed to investigate how the mother’s thyroid function and the presence of thyroid autoimmunity in early pregnancy are associated with offspring’s language acquisition at the age of 12-37 months.

Methods: This study was embedded in the prospective Odense Child Cohort (OCC). Mothers were excluded in case of known thyroid disease. A blood sample was drawn at median 12th gestational week (range: 8-20) and analyzed for free thyroxine (FT4), thyrotropin, and anti-peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb). The Danish adaption of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDI) parent reports was assessed every third month when the child was 12-37 months and was used to evaluate the offspring’s vocabulary. Data from all completed MB-CDI reports (productive vocabulary) for each child was included in the analysis. Associations between maternal FT4, thyrotropin, and TPOAb, respectively, and scores in the MB-CDI were evaluated by conditional growth models, with thyroid variables as predictors, estimating inter-individual variability in intra-individual patterns of change (in MB-CDI-scores) over time (offspring age) and main effects of covariates.

Results: The study included 735 mother-child pairs (383 boys and 352 girls). The probability of producing words within the MB-CDI at the age of 12 to 37 months correlated negatively with maternal FT4 in both girls and boys (P < 0.001). Likewise, language acquisition was better in both girls and boys when maternal FT4 was below the 20th percentile compared to children exposed to a maternal FT4 above the 80th percentile (P < 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively). Language acquisition was better for girls with maternal thyrotropin >2.5 mIU/L than for those with maternal thyrotropin ≤2.5 mIU/L (P < 0.001). The same trend was evident for boys after the age of 27 months (P < 0.001). Language acquisition at age 12-37 months for both girls and boys was inversely correlated with TPOAb levels, as TPOAb >11 kIU/L decreased the probability of producing words compared to those with maternal TPOAb levels <11 kIU/L (P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Language acquisition in offspring at age 12-37 months correlated inversely with maternal FT4 and serological markers of thyroid autoimmunity in early pregnancy. Thus, thyroid autoimmunity per se may have a negative impact on fetal neural development. However, the finding that maternal thyroid function in the lower-normal range may be favorable for language acquisition contrasts with the current perception.  </div>

Does sex/gender matter for language acquisition? Small advantages in vocabulary size for females are well documented. In this study, however, we found that children’s early vocabulary composition was a significantly better predictor of sex/gender than their vocabulary size. We conducted classification analysis on word-production data from children (12–36 months old, n = 39,553) acquiring 26 different languages. Children’s sex/gender was classified at above-chance levels in 22 of 26 languages. Classification accuracy was significantly higher than for models based on vocabulary size and increased as a function of sample size. Boys produced more words for vehicles and outdoor scenes, whereas girls produced more words for clothing and body parts. Classification accuracy also increased as a function of age and peaked at 30 months, reaching accuracy levels observed in studies of adult word use. These differences in vocabulary are indicative of differences in the lifeworld of children and may themselves cause further differences in development.</div>

Language development during early childhood is considered an important marker of fetal neurodevelopment. Prenatal cortisol exposure plays a critical role in maturation of the fetal brain; however, the effect on offspring language development needs further investigation. In this prospective observational study we aimed to evaluate the association between maternal third trimester cortisol and early longitudinal offspring language development in the Odense Child Cohort (OCC) and to test whether there were sex differences in the association. The study cohort included 1093 mother–child dyads (570 boys and 523 girls). Fasting morning serum (s-) cortisol was collected from third trimester (gestational week 26–28) pregnant women and measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Offspring receptive and productive vocabulary assessments by MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories parent reports were completed every third month from children age 12–37 months. Levels of cortisol were higher in women carrying a girl (858 ± 214 nmol/L) than in women carrying a boy (820 ± 222 nmol/L). Higher third trimester maternal cortisol levels showed a positive association with development of productive vocabulary in boys at age 12–21 months (OR = 1.23, SE = 0.07, p =.005) and age 22–37 months (OR = 1.09, SE = 0.06, p =.967). Higher maternal cortisol levels in the third trimester were positively associated with receptive vocabulary in girls at 12–21 months of age (OR = 1.16, SE = 0.05, p =.002). Maternal third trimester s-cortisol levels were positively associated with early language development in children at age 12–37 months.</div>

Parenting self-efficacy has been tied to myriad child outcomes during middle childhood and adolescence, directly and indirectly through parenting practices. The present study examines contemporaneous associations between parenting self-efficacy, parenting practices, and child outcomes during the preschool years in a community sample of 1455 Danish parents (76.7 % mothers) of 3–5-year-old children (49 % girls). Parents (M = 39.2 years old) completed a survey describing parenting self-efficacy and three facets of parenting practices: inductive reasoning, psychological control, and instrumental reward. Parents also described child adjustment in four domains: prosocial behavior, hyperactivity, conduct problems, and emotional problems. Results revealed direct concurrent associations between parenting self-efficacy and each child outcome, with greater efficacy tied to more prosocial behavior and less hyperactivity, conduct problems, and emotional problems. Parent psychological control mediated associations from parenting self-efficacy to child hyperactivity, conduct problems, and emotional problems. Inductive reasoning mediated associations from parenting self-efficacy to child prosocial behavior. Consistent with previous findings from older children, parental use of psychological control had debilitating consequences for preschool children. Inductive reasoning, in contrast, appeared to promote positive development.</div>

The world’s languages vary in almost every conceivable way, yet children readily learn their native language. Understanding how children can acquire such a diversity of different languages has been a long-standing goal for psychological science, yet current acquisition research is dominated by studies of children learning one particular language: English. In this article, we argue that progress toward this goal will require systematic comparisons between different languages. We propose three levels of comparison: coarse-grained comparisons contrasting unrelated languages to confirm or refute broad theoretical claims, fine-grained comparisons between closely related languages to investigate the impact of specific factors on acquisition outcomes, and within-language comparisons targeting the impact of socio-communicative differences on learning. This three-pronged comparative approach to language acquisition promises to provide new insights into the mechanisms and processes by which children acquire their native tongue under such varied linguistic and socio-communicative conditions.</div>

The study by Kidd and Garcia is long overdue. Their analyses of published research on language acquisition highlight the lack of typological diversity in studies of how children acquire their native tongue. We concur with their conclusion that more research on understudied languages is urgently needed. However, we argue that what the field needs is not just wider cross-linguistic coverage but a systematic comparative approach to language acquisition – one in which investigations of well-studied languages still has much to contribute.</div>

Background
Prenatal exposure to organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides has been associated with impaired neurodevelopment. Few longitudinal studies have investigated associations with early language development in populations with mainly low dietary exposure.

Objective
To investigate associations between biomarkers of maternal gestational exposure to organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides and the child's language development at age 20–36 months in the prospective Odense Child Cohort.

Methods
Metabolites of organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides were measured in maternal urine samples collected at gestational week 28. Language development was assessed among 755 singletons at age 20–36 months using the Vocabulary and Complexity scores of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories, standardized into age and sex specific percentile scores according to a Danish reference study. Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of scoring below the 15th percentile scores in relation to maternal urinary insecticide metabolite concentrations after adjustment for confounders.

Results
The generic pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) and the chlorpyrifos metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY) were detectable in more than 90% of the urine samples analyzed. Likewise, 82.2% had detectable concentrations of diethyl phosphates (DE) and 58.4% of dimethyl phosphates (DM), both of which are common metabolites of organophosphate insecticides. None of the metabolites was associated with higher odds of delayed results below the 15th percentile language scores. In contrast, reduced probability for scoring below the 15th percentile Vocabulary score was seen for the highest tertile of 3-PBA in boys and for the upper tertile of TCPY and DE in girls.

Conclusion
In this prospective cohort, with predominantly dietary insecticide exposure, we found no evidence that gestational exposure to organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides adversely affected early language development in the children. The observed indication of a positive effect of insecticides on language development may be explained by residual and unmeasured confounding from socioeconomic factors and dietary habits. Follow-up of these children should include assessment of more complex cognitive functions in later childhood, as well as associations with their own postnatal insecticide exposure.</div>

It is often assumed that all languages are fundamentally the same. This assumption has been challenged by research in linguistic typology and language evolution, but questions of language learning and use have largely been left aside. Here we review recent work on Danish that provides new insights into these questions. Unlike closely related languages, Danish has an unusually reduced phonetic structure, which seemingly delays Danish-learning children in several aspects of their language acquisition. Adult language use appears to be affected as well, resulting, among other things, in an increased dependence on top-down information in comprehension. In this conceptual review, we build the argument that a causal relationship may exist between the sound structure of Danish and the peculiarities of its acquisition and use. We argue that a theory of language learning that accommodates the existing evidence from Danish must explicitly account for the interaction between learner-related factors and language-specific constraints.</div>
